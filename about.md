I am an MSc student in social data science at the University of Oxford. Prior to this I studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Oxford from 2019 to 2022. 

I am American and British, and grew up primarily in Indiana before moving to the UK for university.

My main interests are political sociology and electoral politics, especially in Europe, the United States, and Israel. During my undergraduate degree, I researched the relationship between attitudes towards immigration and support for the European radical left. You can read it <a href="assets/pdfs/thesis.pdf">here</a>. My current research concerns the impact of Fox News exposure on legislator language and ideology. In my free time, I do random data analysis with R and Python. I also maintain the web app Build a British Voter, where you can build a voter and see their predicted voting behaviour in the 2019 general election. You can find it <a href="https://web-production-4f82.up.railway.app/">here</a>.
